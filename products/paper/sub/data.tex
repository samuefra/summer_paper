The first database of this work is TAQ Returns. The TAQ Returns database is a financial database that contains information on the returns of all stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). We have around ten thousand assets entering and leaving the database from January 2003 to December 2020.

The TAQ Returns database provides return data at different frequencies, ranging from daily frequency to minute and second frequencies. For example, you can get return data for intervals such as 30, 15, 5, and 1 minute, as well as 30, 15, and 5 seconds. This allows for a more detailed and accurate analysis of stock performance over different time frames.

The second database was built using two different sets of data. The first contains data about PERMNO and TAQ\_TICKER. The second dataset also has the PERMNO column, which is the variable we connect the two datasets with, and several columns that give us the percentiles of companies on where they are located based on financial factors. Companies are grouped into ten percentiles. Thus, each firm receives values between 1 and 10.

With the TAQ Returns database and this last one together, we can construct some factors widely used in finance literature. We show below how these factors are constructed.


\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Size} ($size$)
	
	Based on \citeonline{fama1993common} we can built the first two factors, $size$ and $value$.
	
	\begin{align*}
		size &= \mathrm{ME}_{\text{Jun}} \\
	\end{align*}
	
	They construct six portfolios, $S/L, S/M, S/H, B/L, B/M, B/H$ from the intersections of two $\mathrm{ME}$ (Market Equity - price times shares) and three $\mathrm{BE}/\mathrm{ME}$ (Ratio of Book Equity to Market Equity) groups. The size breakpoint for year $t$ is the median NYSE market equity at the end of June of year $t$, breaking the first group $\mathrm{ME}$ into two, $S$ (Small) and $B$ (Big). The $SMB$ (Small minus Big) factor is, therefore, the average return on the three small portfolios minus the average return on the three big portfolios.
	
	\begin{align*}
		SMB &= \frac{1}{3}\left(S/L + S/M + S/H\right) - \frac{1}{3}\left(B/L + B/M + B/H\right)
	\end{align*}
	Rebalanced annually.


	
	\item \textbf{Value (annual)} ($value$)
	
	Follows \citeonline{fama1993common}. 
	
	\begin{align*}
		value &= \frac { \mathrm{BE} }{ \mathrm{ME} } \\
	\end{align*}

	 The $\mathrm{BE}/\mathrm{ME}$ group is broken into three book-to-market equity groups based on the breakpoints until the 30th $\mathrm{BE}/\mathrm{ME}$ percentile is $L$ (Low), from 30th until 70th percentile is $M$ (Middle) and finally the top 30th percentile $H$ (High). $\mathrm{BE}/\mathrm{ME}$ for June of year $t$ is the book equity for the last fiscal year end in $t-1$ divided by $\mathrm{ME}$ for December of $t-1$. The $HML$ (High minus Low) factor is the average return on the two high portfolios minus the average return on the two low portfolios. 
	
	\begin{align*}
		HML &= \frac{1}{2}\left(S/H + B/H\right) - \frac{1}{2}\left(S/L + B/L\right)
	\end{align*}
	Rebalanced annually.



	\item \textbf{Gross Profitability} ($prof$)
	
	Follows \citeonline{novy2013other}. 
	
	\begin{align*}
		prof &= \frac{ \mathrm{GP} }{ \mathrm{AT} } \\
	\end{align*}
	
	Profitability is measured by the ratio of a firm's gross profits (revenues minus cost of goods sold) to its assets. The gross profitability factor is constructed using the basic methodology employed in the construction of $HML$. The strategy are long (short) firms in the top (bottom) tertile by NYSE breaks on the profitability sorting variable. The returns of this portfolio are value-weighted and rebalanced annually at the end of June based on its performance over the first 11 months of the preceding year and gross profits-to-assets. The $PMU$ (Profitable minus Unprofitable) factor is 
	
	\begin{align*}
		PMU &= P - U
	\end{align*}
	where $GP$ is gross profits and $AT$ is total assets, $P$ and $U$ are, respectively, the value-weighted portfolio of the top 30th percentile and the bottom 30th percentile.
	
	
	
	\item \textbf{Value-Profitability} ($valprof$).
	
	Follows \citeonline{novy2013other}. 
	
	\begin{align*}
		valprof = \operatorname{rank}(value) + \operatorname{rank}(prof)
	\end{align*}
	Sum of ranks in univariate sorts on book-to-market and profitability. Annual book-to-market and profitability values are used for the entire year. Rebalanced annually.
	
	The strategy that the author consider is construct within the 500 largest non-financial stocks for which gross profits-to-assets and book-to-market are both available. Each year these stocks are ranked on both their gross profits-to-assets and book-to-market ratios, from 1 (lowest) to 500 (highest). At the end of each June the strategy buys one dollar of each of the 150 stocks with the highest ($H$) combined profitability and value ranks, and it shorts one dollar of each of the 150 stocks with the lowest ($L$) combined ranks.
		
	\begin{align*}
		HML = H - L
	\end{align*}
	
	
	
	\item \textbf{Piotroski's F-score} ($F$-$score$)

		& + 1_{\Delta \text{ATL}>0} + 1_{\text{EqIss} \leq 0} + 1_{\Delta \text{GM}>0} + 1_{\Delta \text{ATO}>0}

	\end{align*}
	Present value of expected cashflows. Cashflows' components (from clean surplus identity, ROE and book equity growth) are forecasted using AR(1). Sums are discounted using a constant discount rate. Rebalanced monthly.

%% PORTUGUESE VERSION

%A primeira base de dados deste trabalho é o TAQ Returns. O banco de dados TAQ Returns é um banco de dados financeiro que contém informações sobre os retornos de todas as ações listadas na Bolsa de Valores de Nova York (NYSE). Temos cerca de dez mil ativos entrando e saindo do banco de dados no período de janeiro de 2003 a dezembro de 2020.
%
%O banco de dados TAQ Returns fornece dados de retorno em diferentes frequências, variando de frequência diária a frequências por minuto e por segundo. Por exemplo, você pode obter dados de retorno para intervalos como 30, 15, 5 e 1 minuto, bem como 30, 15 e 5 segundos. Isso permite uma análise mais detalhada e precisa do desempenho das ações em diferentes intervalos de tempo.
%
%O segundo banco de dados foi montado usando dois conjuntos diferentes de dados. O primeiro contém dados sobre PERMNO e TAQ\_TICKER. O segundo conjunto de dados também possui a coluna PERMNO, que é a variável que conectamos os dois conjuntos de dados e várias colunas que nos fornecem o percentis de empresas sobre onde estão localizadas com base em fatores financeiros. As empresas estão agrupadas em dez percentis. Assim, cada firma recebe valores entre 1 e 10.
%
%Com o banco de dados TAQ Returns e este último juntos, podemos construir alguns fatores amplamente utilizados na literatura de finanças. Mostramos a seguir como esses fatores são construídos.
